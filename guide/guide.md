# LittleSis Code and Development Guide

Welcome to the LittleSis project! LittleSis has been tracking powerful people and organizations since 2009. This guide will help you understand the LittleSis data model, how the code is structured, and how we host our site.


## Code and components

All our code can be found under the github organization [public-accountability](https://github.com/public-accountability). 

While the core of LittleSis.org is rails, we have some related components that use other technologies.

The repo [littlesis-main](https://github.com/public-accountability/littlesis-main) contains instructions for getting the development environment setup (via docker), an ansible playbook for running LittleSis in production, and this guide. 

[littlesis-rails](https://github.com/public-accountability/littlesis-rails) is the central rails repository for the project.

[oligrapher](https://github.com/public-accountability/oligrapher) is our javascript/react mapping tool. 

[littlesis-browser-addon](https://github.com/public-accountability/littlesis-browser-addon) is a chrome browser extension to add relationships to the database.

[pai-core-functionality](https://github.com/public-accountability/pai-core-functionality), [pai-packages](https://github.com/public-accountability/pai-packages), [pai](https://github.com/public-accountability/pai), [littlesis-packages](https://github.com/public-accountability/littlesis-packages), [littlesis-news-theme](https://github.com/public-accountability/littlesis-news-theme), and [littlesis-core-functionality](https://github.com/public-accountability/littlesis-core-functionality) are the themes and functionality for our two wordpress sites: [news.littlesis.com](https://news.littlesis.com) and [public-accountability.org](https://public-accountability.org/).
